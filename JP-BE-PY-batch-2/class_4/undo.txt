Git reset <filename>
Git reset HEAD~1 # by default soft delete

git reset --soft HEAD~5
Effect: Moves HEAD to the commit 5 steps back but does not change the working directory or the index.
Result: All changes from the last 5 commits will be staged. The working directory will still reflect the most recent state before the reset, but all changes from those 5 commits will be in the staging area.
Git reset â€“hard HEAD~1

# undo git reset command
git reflog # git running command history
git reset "HEAD@{num}"
