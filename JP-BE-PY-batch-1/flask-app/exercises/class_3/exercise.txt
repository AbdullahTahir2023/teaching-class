create an app similar to the Google Keep Notes app.

your app should have following features
- register the user
- login the user with email and password
- (after login) user can create the notes
- user can assign notes one or more categories
- user can view all his the notes
- user can view the notes of selected category

Note: restrict user to view it's own content and not others i.e User X cannot view the notes of User Y.

Note:
- create apis using view function for modular code.
- use jwt token for session management
- create decorator named "token_required" and use it on protected apis
