Swapping two number means exchanging the values of two variables. 
Suppose you have two variable var1 and var2. 
Value of var1 is 20 and value of var2 is 40. 
So, after swapping the value of var1 will become 40 & value of var 2 will become 20.

x = 1

# use some technique here to swap the varibale values

print("x is", x)

# solution:
z = x
x = y
y = z
