data-structure
  1. for a given problem, you have to use a correct data-strcuture
  2. list is good for traversing while dict(hash) is good for retrieving single object
  3. list, dict, linked list, stack, queue


Big O Notation
  1. time complexity + space complexity = what impact on the application runnnig time or space encouter when the input size grows
  2. do not confuse it with hardware power, 1 computer can run the the algo in 2 seconds while the other can take 10 seconds.

  4. summary:
    - O(1): list[0] -> constant
    - O(Log n): -> Logarithmic Time
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307283/what-does-olog-n-mean-exactly
      - Divide and conquer
    - O(n): loop on list and print element -> Linear
    - O(n2): nested loop -> Quadratic Time
    - ​​O(n log n) – Quasilinear Time
    - Order and also exmplanation
