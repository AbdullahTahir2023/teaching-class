# 1. output the numbers from 1 to 10 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# 1
# 2
# 3
# etc

# 2. output the numbers from 35 to 50 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# 35
# 36
# 37
# etc


# 3. output the numbers from -15 to -25 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# -15
# -16
# -17
# etc

# 4. output the numbers from 5 to -10 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# 5
# 4
# 3
# etc

# 5. output the numbers from 0 to 50 incremented by 3 using range function and for loop
# output should be like
# 0
# 3
# 6

# etc

# 6.  Write a program to Generate Multiplication Table of 2 using range function and for loop
# output format should be like
# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# etc


# 7. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list use for loop. consider the list [3, 5, 2, 1, 4]
# output should be 15
# hint: 
# create a variable x outside the loop and assign the value 0
# inside the loop increment the value of x with the local variable of loop
# x += i


# 8. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list and use for loop consider the list [3, 5, 2, 1, 4]
# output should be 5
# hint:
# create a variable x outside the loop and assign the value 0
# inside the loop compare the variable x with the local variable of loop
