# Write a Python program to copy a list using for loop. consider a list
li = [1, 2, 3, 4]
li_2 = []
# use for loop and add al the items in li_2

# Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.
# consider list l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4] and l2 = [5, 6, 7, 3]
# in both list value "3" is common
# use for loop
# hint: nested loop

# Write a program to display index and the values (both) of a list using for loop. consider a list l = [100, 200, 300, 400]
# output: 
# 0 100
# 1 200
# 2 300
# 3 400

# Write a program that find common values between 2 lists and also tells how many times the common value occurs.
# consider the list l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] and l2 = ['e', 'b', 'g', 'd', 'f', 'h']
# output:
# {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 2, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 1}
# hint: use nested loop

# consider the number 2783, the number consists of 4 digits.
# Count the total number of digits in a number using while loop.
# instruction (hint):
# x = 2783
# counter = 0
# run while loop as long as x becomes 0
# increment the counter inside while loop
# divide x by 10 using floor division syntax "//"

# Write a program that takes user input and display it. The program keep ask user the input until user enters “0”


# Write a program and ask user to enter number, 5 times using while loop. store each value in list.
# calculate the sum of all values in a list


# Write a program to keep asking for a number until you enter a negative number. At the end, print the sum of all entered numbers.


# Write a program to ask for a name until the user enters END. Print the name each time. When you are done, print "I am done."


# consider the list l1 [11, 33, 50]. use for loop to output the result like "113350"

# Write a Python program to copy a dict using for loop. consider a dict
d1 = {"id": 1, "name": "your-name", "gender": "male"}
d2 = {}
# use for loop and add al the items in d2
