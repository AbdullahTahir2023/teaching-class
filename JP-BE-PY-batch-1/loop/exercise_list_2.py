# 1. Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a list and use for loop. consider the list [3, 5, 2, 1, 4].
# output should be 360
# hint: use a variable x outside the loop and assign the first value of list
# inside the loop * the value of x with the local variable of loop
# x *= 


# 2. create a list from 0 to 100 using range function and iterate over the list
# display the number that satisfied following conditions
# The number must be divisible by 5
# If the number is greater than 30 and less than 50 then skip it
# If the number is greater than 80, then stop the loop


# 3. consider the following list ['cat', 'dog', 'hand', 'freedom', 'jump', 'frog', 'happy', 'popcorn', 'tiger']
# display the word that contains character longer than 5
# the output should be freedeom and popcorn

# 4. Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements using for loop. Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow'] Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']


# 5. Write a program to display odd numbers only. odd number upto 100
# hint use for loop and range function

# 6. List contains 30 elements. Display first 5 and last 5 elements

# 7. Display output: helloworld from the list [‘h’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘w’, ‘o’, ‘r’, ‘l’, ‘d’]
# output should be 'helloworld' in one line

# 8. Write a Python program to append a list to the second list.
# consider l1 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and l2 is []
# using loop add items of l1 in l2

# 9. consider the list ['hi', 'hello', 'hi', 'good morning', 'hi', 'bye']
# use for loop and find the count that how many times the word "hi" present in list.
# output should be 3
