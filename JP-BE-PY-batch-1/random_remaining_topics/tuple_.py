# tuple

# create tuple. its just like list
# l = [1, 2, 3, 4] # this is a list
# t = (1, 2, 3, 4) # this is a tuple

# print(type(l))
# print(type(t))

# how to access element of the tuple, its just like list
# print(l[0])
# print(t[0])

# how to iterate on tuple, its just like list
# for item in t:
#   print(item)

# how to convert list to tuple, its just like we convert int to str etc
# l = [1, 2, 3, 4] # this is a list
# t = tuple(l)


# how to delete the element from tuple?
# unlike list, tuple cannot be modified.
# tuple doesn't contain any method to add, update or delete the elements


# what is the benefit of using tuple
# tuple data structure is memory efficient as compare to list
# tuple is used to return multiple values from the function
# tuple is immutable


# tuple methods

# index() -> used to find the index of the given value

# t = ("danish", "age", "car", "age")
# print(t.index("car")) # 2

# count() -> used to find the number of occurances of the given value

# t = ("danish", "age", "car", "age", "age")
# print(t.count("age")) # 3
